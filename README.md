Formal (i.e. machine-readable) ontologies are a time-tested and platform-agnostic technology that allows subject matter experts and hobbyists to create classification systems, organizing concepts within specific domains of knowledge and enabling users to make inferences about the relationships between them.

GryphOntology is a formal domain ontology - in this case, a bestiary - that aims to foster creativity and facilitate research for both entertainment and scholastic communities concerned with creatures of lore.
